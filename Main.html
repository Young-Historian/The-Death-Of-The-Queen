	<p style="font-family: Arial;color: #528204;font-size: 18px;text-align: justify;">Let us tell you a story about the death of the queen. Queen Elizabeth II died recently on September 8, 2022. It is said she died due to natural causes. But it is a rumour. Let me tell you the story, how she died. First, it all started when she was roaming Paris just for fun in August 29, 2022. 
	And she found a cave. </p><br>

	<p style="font-family: Arial;color: #528204;font-size: 18px;text-align: justify;">She was about to enter the cave but the royal secretary Edward Young said "Your Majesty, it could be dangerous." The queen replied "How dare you provoke me. I will execute you if you do it again.". Edward tried again "Your Majesty, I will go in first.".The queen said "Soldiers, take him to mental hospital." The royal guard said "Your Majesty, Edward is right.". Before anyobdy could say anything, she ran into the cave.</p>

	<p style="font-family: Arial;color: #528204;font-size: 18px;text-align: justify;">Edward and the Royal Guards ran after her. It was the entrance to hell! They ran out and the queen was given bad luck. That is why she died. She is now in <b><font color="red">hell<font></b>.</p><br>
